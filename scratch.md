# The two party system and their backers fiscally oppress, but they needn't do so

We need to consider that both the Democratic party and
Republican party largely exist to serve elites. The elites
that favor one party over the other (if indeed there is
any real favor -- cite Lessig or others on elites donating
to both parties) may have particular fiscal reasons
(capitalists: e.g. compare a tech company to a coal mining company)
or social preferences (Hollywood celebrity compared to a televangelist),
but in the end, they are the least likely to be directly impacted
by which party is in control. Afterall, they have wealth, they have
lawyers, and with either party, none of that is significantly at
risk.

Whether we get trickle-down economics and tax breaks for the wealthy
from the Republicans, or moderate tax hikes on the wealthy from the
Democrats, the elite will have the same life, likely all the same
tangible assets, and the only real difference that will be seen
is a slight blip on their ledgers.

Neither party has significantly helped the working class or those
hardest hit by circumstances. While rural areas tend to have more
conservative voters, I believe this is largely based on the social
aspects (TODO: check morality/psychology video and cite)

We have a shrinking middle class, which is also ideal for the elite.
The middle class, like the wealthy class itself, offers the chance
at education an improved chance (but certainly not a guarantee) for reflection
and progressive spirit.

TODO: transition

Feminism and equality itself have been exploited by the capitalist system.
Rather than keeping wages constant and being able to support a family
on one full-time, blue-collar income, we're now in a situation where
both parents often need to work to support fewer children (I'm not
actually advocating having more children in general, but the point remains,
that it is now more expensive to raise children than it once was
due to increasing costs of child-care -- exacerbated by, once again,
often needing both parents to work, unreasonable needs and costs of education,
and the general inflation compared to wage deflation (cite).

In the end, the elite often oppress. Not all of them, for instance, I
would argue Bill Gates has done a significant amount of good, despite
loathing his business tactics and policies when he was CEO of Microsoft.
But most elite only go out on a limb for us (or purport to do so), when
it aligns with their own interests, and certainly they are less likely
to do so if it doesn't benefit them or disadvantages them even slightly.
This seems unusual to me. Many parents are happy to pay higher property
taxes to live in an area with better schools. By extrapolating this
to the national level, wouldn't it be worthwhile to have the right
programs in place to make sure that no-one is poor? We can do that (cite)
while still having rich people.

Not only is preventing poverty an ethical ideal, it makes the country
a better place for everyone. Certainly by those that are rescued from poverty, but
if people aren't poor, they will have fewer complaints, fewer health issues,
fewer reasons to commit crimes, and have more resources to help in
their contributing back to society. They'll have more opportunities
to learn basic scientific principles, critical thinking, and education.
Building on this, they'll be more likely to want to contribute back to society,
likely be better parents (I'm not saying money makes a good parent, but
not having to struggle as a child would increase psychological well being
and improved access to resources). They would also be less likely to
engage in dangerous drug habits. All of these advantages work synergystically,
and they all make society a better place.

I know there are some that think perhaps poverty is a place where the undeserving
go, or that they must be tested and rise above it. Some few rise from poverty,
but this pick-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps mentality does not typically happen.
Some will say: why should I have to work hard and others get a free ride?
To be clear, I think hard work should always be rewarded. But we need some base-level
safety net to keep people, and our society, from falling ill. It isn't communist,
but it is in line with the ideals of social democracy.

# How to engage with the other side

## General advice

1. Don't assume, or come off, as you know the answer. Most of the time,
people have deep-seated reasons for believing what they do.

## If you are a conservative

1. Try to respect others beliefs and ways of life. You may not
agree with them or endorse them, but respect is needed for
reasoned discourse, and you may gain a friend that you disagree with.
An honest friend may be someone that tells you what you don't want to


## If you are a liberal

1.
