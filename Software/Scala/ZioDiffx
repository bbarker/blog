[At work](https://www.linkedin.com/company/caesars-digital/mycompany/)
we use the [diffx](https://github.com/softwaremill/diffx)
family of libraries for displaying mismatching data structures.
Diffx offers several testing library integrations, including for
ScalaTest, which is what we predominantly use. However, we have
started using zio-test on a limited basis as well; zio-test can
more easily work with ZIO effects, and tests themselves can be
effects, which makes the UX of the testing experience much better.
This is particularly important as our service becomes
more heavily managed by the ZIO effect system and runtime.


## ZIO 2

In ZIO 2, custom assertions will be possible, so we won't have to
chain on an existing assertion. Currently the effect of this is
that we get two error messages when there is a mismatch: one
from the boolean test, and one from the label that actually
prints the mismatched data structures.


## Scala 3

Currently, there are no diffx-core artifacts published for Scala 3,
but there have been some PRs merged that add support for Scala 3,
so we can expect to see it at some point. If someone adds support
for Scala 3, feel free to put in a PR if you beat me to it!
